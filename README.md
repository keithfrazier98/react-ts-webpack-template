# React Template 

Barebones started template, should be able to clone and get started. 

- Webpack
- Typescript
- Husky
- Prettier
- Eslint
    - Eslint comes with multiple plugins in a custom config. Opted towards a custom config bc I typically use AirBnB, but they dont support eslint 9 and getting their guide to work with 8 was a headache.
 
Todo: 

- Eslint fileCheck
- Webpack hot reloads
